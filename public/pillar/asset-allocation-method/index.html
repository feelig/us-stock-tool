      <p>This pillar explains Asset Allocation Method through the Market Risk Index (MRI) lens. It is designed to help investors interpret stock market risk signals without turning them into short-term timing.</p>
<p>FinLogicHub5 uses a risk→allocation→action framework. The goal is to adjust exposure only when regime conditions shift or when risk thresholds are crossed.</p>
<p>The MRI combines trend, stress, and regime signals. Each component is evaluated on a consistent scale so that daily updates are comparable over time.</p>
<p>A good risk system should be stable, explainable, and actionable. Stability avoids whipsaw, explainability builds trust, and actionability improves portfolio outcomes.</p>
<p>Risk-on regimes typically support higher equity exposure, while risk-off regimes call for capital preservation. The neutral regime is a balance between the two.</p>
<p>Investors often confuse risk signals with return forecasts. MRI is not a return predictor. It is a structured gauge of market risk.</p>
<p>If you adjust allocation, do so with defined ranges. Use the same ranges consistently so you can measure whether the discipline helped over a full market cycle.</p>
<p>Regime duration matters. A short-lived risk-off regime may not require aggressive de-risking, while a long regime suggests sustained caution.</p>
<p>Review changes weekly. The daily signal is best used as an awareness tool rather than a daily trading trigger.</p>
<p>Use archives to study past regimes and compare outcomes. This builds intuition and avoids overconfidence.</p>

<h2>Risk Model Explanation</h2><p>The Market Risk Index (MRI) is composed of three components: trend, stress, and regime. Each component is mapped to a 0–100 risk scale and then blended into a unified score. The purpose is not to forecast returns, but to describe risk conditions consistently.</p>
<p>Trend component reflects price persistence. When price is sustained above long-term moving averages, trend risk is lower. When price falls below long-term averages and the slope deteriorates, trend risk rises.</p>
<p>Stress component captures volatility and drawdown pressure. Higher realized volatility and deeper drawdowns increase the stress score, indicating that the probability of adverse outcomes is rising even if the price trend appears stable.</p>
<p>Regime component measures relative risk appetite using cross-asset signals. When risk assets underperform defensives, regime risk increases; when risk assets lead, regime risk declines.</p>
<p>MRI uses a stepped scoring model (0/25/50/75/100) per component to reduce noise. This prevents excessive churn and makes the signal explainable. The blended score is then smoothed against the previous day to avoid whipsaw.</p>
<p>Allocation guidance is derived from the score band. Low risk implies a higher equity range, neutral risk implies balanced exposure, and high risk implies capital preservation. The allocation range is a guardrail, not a rigid target.</p>
<p>The model prioritizes stability and clarity. A small daily change should not trigger allocation changes unless it results in a regime shift or a threshold breach.</p>

<h2>Historical Case Study</h2><p>2020 COVID shock: risk rose rapidly as volatility expanded and trend broke. MRI would have moved from low/neutral to high risk in days, pushing allocation ranges lower. This protected capital during peak drawdown and created capacity to re-risk as trend stabilized.</p>
<p>2022 bear market: regime stayed risk-off for an extended period. Trend risk stayed elevated while stress remained persistently high. MRI would have signaled sustained caution, preventing premature re-risking during bear market rallies.</p>
<p>Recent risk-off episode: the latest regime shift occurred when risk assets underperformed defensives and volatility re-accelerated. The model weighted regime and stress, triggering a higher score even before the headline index fully recovered.</p>
<p>Across these cases, the key insight is not the exact timing of the peak or trough. The value comes from aligning exposure with the prevailing risk regime and reducing large drawdowns.</p>
<p>Historical behavior shows that regime shifts tend to cluster. Once a regime turns risk-off, it often persists long enough to justify reduced exposure. Conversely, risk-on regimes tend to last longer than most investors expect.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><b>Daily:</b> check MRI level and any regime/threshold alert.</li>
      <li><b>Weekly:</b> review the weekly strategy and confirm allocation bands.</li>
      <li><b>Adjustment:</b> only change allocation when regime shifts or risk breaches thresholds.</li>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <h3>Does MRI predict returns?</h3>
    <p>No. MRI summarizes market risk conditions to guide allocation decisions.</p>
    <h3>How often should I adjust allocation?</h3>
    <p>Typically weekly or only when regimes change or thresholds are crossed.</p>
    <h3>What is the biggest mistake?</h3>
    <p>Overreacting to small daily changes. Use regime context and guardrails.</p>
