      <p>This pillar explains Risk Signal vs Timing through the Market Risk Index (MRI) lens. It is designed to help investors interpret stock market risk signals without turning them into short-term timing.</p>
<p>FinLogicHub5 uses a risk→allocation→action framework. The goal is to adjust exposure only when regime conditions shift or when risk thresholds are crossed.</p>
<p>The MRI combines trend, stress, and regime signals. Each component is evaluated on a consistent scale so that daily updates are comparable over time.</p>
<p>A good risk system should be stable, explainable, and actionable. Stability avoids whipsaw, explainability builds trust, and actionability improves portfolio outcomes.</p>
<p>Risk-on regimes typically support higher equity exposure, while risk-off regimes call for capital preservation. The neutral regime is a balance between the two.</p>
<p>Investors often confuse risk signals with return forecasts. MRI is not a return predictor. It is a structured gauge of market risk.</p>
<p>If you adjust allocation, do so with defined ranges. Use the same ranges consistently so you can measure whether the discipline helped over a full market cycle.</p>
<p>Regime duration matters. A short-lived risk-off regime may not require aggressive de-risking, while a long regime suggests sustained caution.</p>
<p>Review changes weekly. The daily signal is best used as an awareness tool rather than a daily trading trigger.</p>
<p>Use archives to study past regimes and compare outcomes. This builds intuition and avoids overconfidence.</p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <h3>Does MRI predict returns?</h3>
    <p>No. MRI summarizes market risk conditions to guide allocation decisions.</p>
    <h3>How often should I adjust allocation?</h3>
    <p>Typically weekly or only when regimes change or thresholds are crossed.</p>
    <h3>What is the biggest mistake?</h3>
    <p>Overreacting to small daily changes. Use regime context and guardrails.</p>
