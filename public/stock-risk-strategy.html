    <h1>Stock Risk Strategy</h1>
    <p class="note">Market Risk Index (MRI) / stock market risk / market risk index</p>

    <h2>Strategy Starts with Risk, Not Prediction</h2>
    <p>A durable stock risk strategy begins by recognizing that risk control comes before return chasing. The Market Risk Index (MRI) helps create that discipline. A market risk index is a structured lens that summarizes trend, stress, and regime conditions. It does not forecast price direction, but it does help you understand how fragile or stable the market is today. By grounding your strategy in risk, you can stay consistent through different market cycles.</p>

    <h2>Position Sizing Based on Risk Levels</h2>
    <p>Position sizing is the most practical application of stock market risk. When MRI indicates low risk, a higher equity allocation may be reasonable if it fits your tolerance. When MRI signals medium risk, many investors keep a core allocation but reduce incremental exposure. When MRI shows high risk, a cautious posture can help protect capital. The idea is to let the market risk index guide your exposure range rather than forcing a binary buy or sell decision.</p>

    <h2>Risk Budgeting and Drawdown Limits</h2>
    <p>A strong stock risk strategy includes a risk budget. This means you define the maximum drawdown you can tolerate and allocate positions accordingly. MRI can serve as a dynamic input. For instance, if MRI rises rapidly, you may tighten your drawdown threshold or reduce leverage. If MRI stabilizes, you may relax constraints. The goal is not to react to every fluctuation, but to keep your risk budget aligned with the current market risk environment.</p>

    <h2>Rebalancing with the Market Risk Index</h2>
    <p>Rebalancing is often overlooked. A market risk index can inform when rebalancing should be more frequent. During high risk regimes, frequent rebalancing can prevent a portfolio from drifting into unwanted exposure. During low risk regimes, you can rebalance less often, reducing transaction costs. This approach turns MRI into a practical control mechanism rather than a headline metric.</p>

    <h2>Combining MRI with Fundamental Views</h2>
    <p>Stock risk strategy does not replace fundamental analysis. It complements it. If you have a strong view on a sector or a company, MRI can help you decide how aggressively to express that view. In a low risk environment, you might size higher. In a high risk environment, you might size smaller or stagger entries. This is how a market risk index becomes a practical tool rather than a standalone signal.</p>

    <h2>Managing Behavioral Risk</h2>
    <p>Many investors lose discipline during volatile periods. A market risk index provides a neutral reference point that reduces emotional decision-making. By setting rules around MRI levels, you can pre-commit to actions that protect you from panic or euphoria. Over time, this can improve both performance stability and psychological resilience. Stock market risk is as much behavioral as it is mathematical.</p>

    <h2>Example Framework</h2>
    <p>A simple framework can look like this: when MRI is low, maintain a higher equity range with diversified exposure. When MRI is medium, keep core holdings but reduce tactical risk. When MRI is high, prioritize capital preservation and wait for risk to normalize. This framework is not universal, but it demonstrates how risk-aware rules can be structured in a way that is repeatable and testable.</p>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>To apply this framework, start by reviewing the current market risk index, then check the daily archive for context. If you need a deeper understanding of risk levels, read the risk level explanation page. If you want to see longer-term context, explore the market risk history page. Together, these resources form a practical toolkit for building a stock risk strategy grounded in observable risk signals.</p>
