    <h1>Market Risk History</h1>
    <p class="note">Market Risk Index (MRI) / stock market risk / market risk index</p>

    <h2>Why Market Risk History Matters</h2>
    <p>Market risk history is not a story of perfect prediction. It is a record of how risk conditions evolve over time. The Market Risk Index (MRI) translates multiple signals into a single risk score so you can see when stock market risk is rising, stabilizing, or falling. By keeping a consistent history, the MRI helps investors and analysts compare regimes across months and years. A market risk index is most useful when it is measured consistently. That is why FinLogicHub5 maintains daily snapshots, and why this page summarizes how market risk history can be interpreted without promising returns.</p>

    <h2>How the MRI Tracks Stock Market Risk</h2>
    <p>The Market Risk Index combines trend, stress, and regime indicators. Trend reflects how price behaves relative to longer-term averages, stress captures volatility and drawdown pressure, and regime represents the risk appetite balance between risk-on and defensive assets. These three components are normalized into a score that reflects stock market risk on a 0–100 scale. When MRI is lower, market risk tends to be contained. When MRI is higher, risk is more elevated. The value is not a forecast; it is a structured, repeatable view of market risk history.</p>

    <h2>Reading the Risk History Curve</h2>
    <p>Market risk history is best understood as a curve rather than a single number. A rising MRI curve means risk is building, and a falling curve suggests risk is easing. This does not guarantee price direction. Instead, it provides an objective measure of risk temperature, which can be useful for position sizing and drawdown planning. For example, if MRI rises while volatility spikes, you may tighten risk controls or reduce exposure. If MRI stabilizes after a volatile period, you may gradually restore allocation. The history gives context, especially when the current MRI value is compared to its recent range.</p>

    <h2>Stock Market Risk and Allocation Discipline</h2>
    <p>Investors often struggle with allocation discipline during risk transitions. Market risk history provides an anchor. By focusing on changes in MRI rather than headlines, you can avoid overreacting to short-term noise. When MRI remains low and trend conditions are stable, a consistent core allocation may be appropriate. When MRI is higher and regime signals are defensive, you may choose to reduce high-beta exposure. The key is that MRI is a risk lens, not a return signal. It helps you balance the probability of drawdowns against your own tolerance.</p>

    <h2>Using Daily Pages as the Source of Truth</h2>
    <p>FinLogicHub5 publishes a daily page that records the MRI, risk level, and supporting explanations. Each daily page is an immutable snapshot, which makes it a useful reference for market risk history. You can move through the archive to observe how risk levels changed across time and how the supporting drivers evolved. This structure also supports a consistent methodology, which is essential when you want to compare different time windows in a reliable way. For daily access, visit the daily archive and select a date.</p>

    <h2>Common Misinterpretations</h2>
    <p>One common mistake is treating MRI as a buy or sell signal. The market risk index is a diagnostic tool. It measures risk conditions and helps you calibrate exposure. Another mistake is ignoring context. A high MRI during a temporary shock can mean different things than a high MRI during a structural downturn. That is why the history matters. It is also why we emphasize risk controls and not predictions. Use MRI to improve your process rather than to replace judgment.</p>

    <h2>How to Combine MRI with Your Process</h2>
    <p>Market risk history should be integrated with your existing risk framework. If you use position sizing rules, the MRI can act as a guardrail. If you run a portfolio, the MRI can inform rebalancing frequency and exposure limits. If you run a single asset strategy, the MRI can guide when to reduce leverage or increase cash. The key is consistency. Over time, a consistent risk lens can reduce behavioral errors and lead to more stable outcomes, even when market risk is elevated.</p>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>To explore the current market risk index, visit the MRI page. To understand the risk levels, read the risk level explanation. To build a practical framework, review the stock risk strategy guide. These pages work together and provide a complete view of market risk history, the current stock market risk environment, and how to apply it in a disciplined way.</p>
