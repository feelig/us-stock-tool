    <h1>Risk Level Explained</h1>
    <p class="note">Market Risk Index (MRI) / stock market risk / market risk index</p>

    <h2>What Does a Risk Level Mean?</h2>
    <p>Risk level is the simplest way to express stock market risk. The Market Risk Index (MRI) converts complex signals into a risk score, then groups the score into low, medium, or high risk. This classification does not forecast returns. Instead, it helps you interpret risk conditions with a consistent framework. Market risk index levels provide clarity by summarizing multiple signals into a single label that is easier to act on. The goal is not to predict the next move, but to understand whether the current environment is more stable or more fragile.</p>

    <h2>Low Risk Level</h2>
    <p>Low risk typically reflects stable trends, controlled volatility, and a constructive risk appetite. In this environment, stock market risk is comparatively contained. MRI may show a low risk level when price trends are above longer-term averages, volatility is moderate, and risk-on assets are stronger than defensive assets. Low risk does not mean zero risk. It means the market risk index is suggesting that the risk temperature is cooler, which may support a higher allocation within your personal limits.</p>

    <h2>Medium Risk Level</h2>
    <p>Medium risk is the most common regime. It often appears during transitions, when some signals are stable while others show early stress. A market risk index that is medium implies balanced conditions: neither extremely safe nor extremely unstable. In this zone, disciplined position sizing matters more than aggressive shifts. Many investors maintain their core allocation while tightening risk controls, such as rebalancing more frequently or setting drawdown thresholds. Medium risk is the zone where process matters most.</p>

    <h2>High Risk Level</h2>
    <p>High risk reflects elevated stress or weakening risk appetite. This may occur when price trends fall below long-term averages, volatility spikes, and defensive assets outperform risk assets. A high market risk index level is a warning sign. It does not guarantee immediate losses, but it signals that the environment is less forgiving. In high risk regimes, investors often reduce exposure, increase diversification, and prioritize liquidity. The objective is to protect capital and reduce the probability of deep drawdowns.</p>

    <h2>How MRI Levels Map to Actions</h2>
    <p>Risk levels should be used as a framework for decision-making, not as a rigid signal. Low risk may support building or maintaining core positions. Medium risk may call for rebalancing or partial hedging. High risk may lead to reduced exposure or tighter risk limits. The key is consistency: using the same market risk index framework across time helps avoid emotional decisions. The MRI is not a prediction engine; it is a risk lens to guide disciplined allocation choices.</p>

    <h2>Why Risk Levels Are Not Price Targets</h2>
    <p>A common misunderstanding is that a low risk level means price will go up, or a high risk level means price will fall. The MRI does not claim that. Stock market risk can remain low even while prices consolidate, and risk can remain high even when prices rally. The risk level simply tells you the state of risk signals. It is useful for risk management, not for timing. This distinction keeps the market risk index honest and useful over long horizons.</p>

    <h2>Using Risk Levels with Your Portfolio</h2>
    <p>Investors can use risk levels to shape position sizing and rebalancing. For example, a low risk level might align with a higher equity allocation, while a high risk level might align with a more defensive posture. The MRI provides a consistent measure that can be integrated into portfolio policy statements. It is especially useful for teams that need an objective measure of stock market risk without relying on narrative or emotion.</p>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>To see the current market risk index level, visit the MRI page. To study risk history, review the market risk history page. To build a process, read the stock risk strategy guide. These pages form a complete view of how risk levels work and how to apply them in practice.</p>
