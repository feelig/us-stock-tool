    <h1>Market Risk Archive — 2026-02</h1>
    <p>Daily MRI reports for 2026-02.</p>

    <div><p>The market risk index is built to translate complex market signals into a single risk level. A monthly risk archive framework helps investors read the environment without chasing noise. This page explains how to interpret the signal, when to adjust exposure, and why risk discipline matters.</p>
<p>Risk-on periods typically reflect stable trend conditions and lower volatility. Neutral periods often appear when trend is mixed or stress is rising but not extreme. Risk-off conditions often coincide with elevated volatility, defensive asset strength, and weaker breadth.</p>
<p>A clear monthly risk archive plan focuses on allocation ranges rather than precise price forecasts. By aligning exposure with a risk level, investors can reduce behavioral errors and avoid overreacting to single-day headlines.</p>
<p>The MRI uses trend, stress, and regime as primary components. Trend reflects price stability relative to long-term averages. Stress captures volatility and drawdown pressure. Regime captures risk-on vs risk-off appetite.</p>
<p>When the risk score rises, the goal is not to predict a crash but to reduce fragility. Lowering equity exposure, raising cash, or diversifying into defensive assets are common responses.</p>
<p>Risk history matters. A single day reading is less informative than a multi-week trend. A sustained risk-on regime suggests stability, while an extended risk-off regime often signals caution.</p>
<p>An effective monthly risk archive approach includes a written playbook. Define actions at low, neutral, and high risk levels. Define rebalancing cadence and drawdown tolerance.</p>
<p>Investors often confuse risk and volatility. Volatility measures dispersion of returns, while risk is the probability of adverse outcomes. The MRI incorporates both trend stability and stress to provide a broader view of market risk.</p>
<p>Market risk signals are best used alongside personal risk capacity. A conservative investor may reduce exposure earlier, while an aggressive investor may tolerate higher drawdowns.</p>
<p>The monthly risk archive lens also improves communication. Teams can reference a common risk level when discussing allocation. This reduces ambiguity and creates consistent reporting.</p>
<p>Even a disciplined system will experience false positives and false negatives. That is why the risk index emphasizes ranges rather than exact timing.</p>
<p>The Daily and Weekly pages provide real-time and periodic context. The Daily page highlights the current score and short-term change. The Weekly report summarizes regime dynamics and allocation posture.</p>
<p>In summary, monthly risk archive is about consistency. The MRI helps investors structure decisions based on measurable risk conditions rather than emotion.</p>
